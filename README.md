# Messenger Demo

This demo application is a simple messaging service. Users can post and retrieve
messages using the REST API.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)


## Running the application locally

There are two options running the demo application locally, the
first one uses `docker-compose`, the latter `docker swarm`.

- Using `Docker Compose`

  ```
  $ docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose-separate-servers.yml up
  ```

  This command will expose 2 services on your system:

  - Spring Boot (instance 1) application on `127.0.0.1:8080`
  - Spring Boot (instance 2) application on `127.0.0.1:8081`

  If you open two separate browsers with `127.0.0.1:8080` and `127.0.0.1:8081`
  you should be able to see the message boards. After you `POST` new messages to the
  correct resource, messages should appear in both browsers.

- Using `Docker Swarm`

  1. Make sure to enable swarm mode

      ```
      $ docker swarm init
      ```

  2. Start the services

      ```
      $ docker stack deploy -c src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml messenger-demo
      ```

  After running these commands you should be able access the application
  on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Please note that by default there are two replicas
  of the backend and reverse-proxy is applied by `docker swarm`.

## REST API

### Retrieve all messages

__URL__: `/messages`

__Method__: `GET`

__Success response__

Code: 200 (OK)

Example response
```
[
  {
    "id":1,
    "content":"Hello"
  },
  {
    "id":2,
    "content":"Hi"
  }
]
```

### Add new message

__URL__: `/messages`

__Method__: `POST`

__Required parameters__

- `content`
  - Content of the message
  - _Type_: _String_

__Example data format__

```
{
  "content": "Hello"
}
```

__Success response__

Code: 201 (Created)

Example response

```
{
  "id":1,
  "content":"Hello"
}
```

__Error response__

Code: 400 (Bad Request)

Cause: Data is not in a valid format

## Getting started with developing the application

1. Start Postgres:

    ```
    $ docker run --name messenger-demo-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=messenger -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=messenger -d postgres
    ```

    Change the parameters according to your system needs. This will expose
    the default Postgres port (5432).

 2. Start RabbitMQ:

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name messenger-demo-rabbit rabbitmq:3
    ```

Running the application with Gradle:

```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

Pushing changes to Docker Hub:

```
$ ./gradlew build dockerPush
```

## Running tests

```
$ ./gradlew test
```

## Running integration tests

Make sure that there is a RabbitMQ instance running then:

```
$ ./gradlew testInteg
```

## Requirements

The task is to implement a data processing pipeline in the cloud.

- Set up a running environment aligned with the technologies mentioned below
- A Readme file containing information you deem useful for someone getting to know your code and want to try the system out
- Develop the application in Java 8, using either DropWizard or Spring Boot as the foundation
- A REST endpoint is taking a dummy JSON input, and the server puts the REST payload on Redis or another tool you think is well suited for the task
- A Consumer is running in the application, taking the freshly received message and persists it in a database of your choice
- A REST endpoint is implemented for retrieving all the messages persisted in JSON format from the database
- The message should also be pushed through Websockets for listening browser clients at the time the message was received on the REST endpoint
- A simple HTML page is implemented to show the real time message delivery
- Please setup a github repository to host the code and share it with your final note for review

We're looking for that:

- All tasks are solved in the solution
- The application has a solid commit history
- The application is built with scalability and maintainability in mind
- The application is built for testability, demonstrated by actual tests
- Your solution reflects a sense of quality you would be confident in releasing to production
- Documentation is applied to code / repository describing intent and purpose, as well as complicated / non obvious choices in the implementation
